Since 2020, the spread of COVID-19 has caused significant damage to the world. The development of COVID-19 vaccines has proved to effectively mitigate the risks of infection and death. However, many elderly individuals in China remained doubted about potential vaccine side effects. 

Therefore, in the summer of 2022, when COVID-19 continued to pose a serious threat in China, I extracted relevant information from global data using MySQL queries and created data visualizations and corresponding dashboards in Tableau. 

I used these visualizations to present the significant contagiousness of COVID-19, the higher mortality rate among elderly patients, and historical data showing reduced risks after vaccine administration. This information was shared with the elderly community to encourage them to get vaccinated and protect their health.
